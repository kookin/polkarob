Polkadot Fullnode Deployment and Update Automation

Description:
This project automates the deployment of two Ubuntu instances on AWS using Terraform. The instances each have some block storage assigned, a pubic IP and a relevant security group for the purpose of interacting on the polkadot network. Once the instances are deployed ansible will install and update Polkadot to the latest code version.
